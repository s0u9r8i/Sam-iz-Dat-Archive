This is a digital archive for "Sam iz Dat: (independent/underground) publications by Chinese-speaking Creators".
Over 240 titles of curated Samizdat from Chinese-speaking creators were presented at Rehearsal Art Book Fair, 
also in the US for the very first time. This signifies our appreciation for the consistent practice of bookmaking 
as personal Rehearsals and Revolutions. We aspire for her significance and impact to endure far beyond 
the mere existence of the exhibition, leaving behind valuable reference materals for future research.

TO BRING A BOOK FAIR BACK TO BOOKS.
Rehearsal Art Book Fair, taking place on Sep 15 and 16, 2023 in New York City, seeks to explore and present 
the essence of independent art and literary publishing within highly capitalized and/or censored contexts.

China, although legends of spirits and ghosts continued to circulate throughout the country, gradually, there were no new supernatural beings emerging. Eventually, even the pre-liberation era spirits and creatures gradually became less active. In the mid-1920s, a young man Yulin Qiu, from Guangdong, went on a journey to Beijing to pursue his education at Yanjing University. It was during this period that Zhou Zuoren initiated the Folk Literature Renaissance Movement, an endeavor that deeply resonated with Yulin Qiu. Filled with inspiration, he eventually returned to his hometown of Chaozhou. Back in Chaozhou, Qiu embarked on a mission to the local community, compelling them to gather stories centering around the region's mythical creatures, spirits, and deities. These captivating tales were meticulously compiled and, in 1930, saw the light of day in the form of a comprehensive volume titled \"\"Tales of Ghosts, Goblins, and Gods of Chaozhou.\"\" However, the passage of three decades would usher in a dark period in the book's history, as it became a casualty of the \"\"Four Olds\"\" movement, subsequently being removed from publication and consigned to oblivion. Remarkably, in recent years, this remarkable collection of stories has remained conspicuously absent from discussions and publications focusing on Chaoshan folklore. Fortunately, a unique copy of \"\"Chaozhou Spirits and Ghost Stories\"\" was preserved and reprinted in 2022 by On Kino. This book documents the tales of spirits and mysteries from the Chaozhou region. What's astonishing is that after more than 60 years, these stories of Chaozhou spirits and supernatural beings are once again meeting a new generation of readers through printed media, preserving this important cultural heritage.\"",
